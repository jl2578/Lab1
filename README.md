# DSAR Lab 1 Starter

This repository contains **Lab 1** for DSAR with a ready-to-use **GitHub Codespaces** dev container.
It pre-installs **Python 3.11**, Jupyter, common data-science libraries, and **GitHub Copilot** extensions.

## Quick Start (Students)

1. Click the **Code** button → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace on main**.
2. Wait for the container to build (~2–5 minutes the first time).
3. Open `Lab1.ipynb`, select the Python kernel if prompted, and start working.
4. **Save** regularly, then **commit** and **push** to keep your work synced to GitHub.
5. When done, **File → Download As** (if needed) or just submit your `.ipynb` per instructions.

> Note: The Copilot extensions are installed in the Codespace, but you’ll need Copilot access on your GitHub account to use them.

## Local Development (Optional)

- You can also open this repo in **VS Code** locally with the **Dev Containers** extension.
- Reopen in Container to get the same environment as Codespaces.
